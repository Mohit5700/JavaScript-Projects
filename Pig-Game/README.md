# Pig Game

## Description
"Pig Game" is a web-based game for two players where each player rolls a dice to accumulate points. The objective is to reach 100 points before the other player. A player can roll the dice as many times as they want during their turn, but if they roll a 1, they lose all points accumulated during that turn. Players can also choose to hold their score, adding the turn's points to their total score and passing the turn to the other player.
